# Language Models use Lookbacks to Track Beliefs

This repository contains the code and experiments for the paper ["Language Models use Lookbacks to Track Beliefs"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14685) by Prakash et al, 2025. The work investigates how language models (specifically Llama-3-70B-Instruct and Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct) represent and track characters' beliefs.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nix07/belief_tracking.git
cd belief_tracking
```

2. Set up the environment:
```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Configure `env.yml` with following environment variables:
- Set `NDIF_KEY` for API access
- Set `HF_WRITE` for Hugging Face access

4. To perform subspace level analysis, you would need singular vectors that you can request by sending an email to [Nikhil](https://nix07.github.io/).

## Usage

The repository contains several components:

1. **Dataset**: The `data/` directory contains the CausalToM templates and synthetic entities used to generate samples. Additionally, it also contains BigToM samples. `src/dataset.py` file contains code for generating and processing the CausalToM dataset.

2. **Notebooks**: The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for various experiments investigating the underlying mechanisms. Use notebooks in `notebooks/causalToM_novis` and `notebooks/causalToM_vis` for mechanism exploration. Notebooks do not include subspace intervention experiments. 

3. **Scripts**: The `scripts/` directory contains utility scripts organized by experiment type:
   - `scripts/patching_scripts/`: Contains patching experiment scripts including `run_single_layer_patching_exps.py` and `run_upto_layer_patching_exps.py` to conduct large-scale interchange intervention experiments, including subspace patching.
   - `scripts/tracing_scripts/`: Contains causal mediation analysis scripts including `trace.py` for tracing experiments.

4. **Results**: The `results/` directory contains experiment outputs organized by experiment type, including attention knockout results, BigToM results, causal mediation analysis results, and CausalToM experiment results.
